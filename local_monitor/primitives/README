Web
===
Run run.sh and go to http://localhost:5000 from a Web browser on the same
machine.


Command-line
============
Run from the PARENT directory:
python3 -m primitives.main a mailbox crossing the street
python3 -m primitives.main a mailman crossing the street

For verbose output:
python3 -m primitives.main -v a mailbox crossing the street
python3 -m primitives.main -v a mailman crossing the street


Tests folder is kind of broken <- use tests in primitives
