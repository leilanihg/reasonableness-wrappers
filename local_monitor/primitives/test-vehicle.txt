Example 1: Greeen light
Scenario : one-lane road, green light, no obstacles
=========================================================================
Assessment of "go": REASONABLE
=========================================================================
python3 -m primitives.representation -v The vehicle waits at a green light

This perception is unreasonable
=============================================
A green light means go, which is inconsistent with waiting.
So it is unreasonable for the vehicle to wait


=========================================================================
Assessment of "wait": UNREASONABLE
=========================================================================
python3 -m primitives.representation -v The vehicle moves at a green light

This perception is reasonable
=============================================
Green means go
So it is reasonable for the vehicle to move

Example 2: Green light with obstruction
Scenario: One-lane road, green light, pedstrian in crosswalk


=========================================================================
Assessment of "go": UNREASONABLE
=========================================================================
python3 -m primitives.representation -v The vehicle moves at a green light
with a pedestrian

This perception is unreasonable
=============================================
Although green means go, green also means yields to pedestrian in the road.
Since there is a pedestrian in the road, move is unreasonable.
So it is unreasonable for the vehicle to move

=========================================================================
Assessment of "wait": REASONABLE
=========================================================================
python3 -m primitives.representation -v The vehicle waits at a green light
with a pedestrian

This perception is reasonable
=============================================
Although green means go, green also means yields to pedestrian in the road.
Since there is a pedestrian in the road, waiting is reasonable.
So it is reasonable for the vehicle to wait

Example 5: Yellow Light
Scenario: One-lane road, yellow light, no obstacles, physics says safe to stop

=========================================================================
Assessment of "go": UNREASONABLE
=========================================================================
python3 -m primitives.representation -v The vehicle moves at a yellow light

This perception is unreasonable
=============================================
A yellow light means 'stop if safe', which is inconsistent with go.
So it is unreasonable for the vehicle to move
This perception is unreasonable

=========================================================================
Assessment of "wait": REASONABLE
=========================================================================
python3 -m primitives.representation -v The vehicle waits at a yellow light

This perception is reasonable
=============================================
A yellow light means 'stop if safe'.  So waiting is reasonable
